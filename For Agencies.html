      <h2>Why Opoint Consulting</h2>
      <p>
        At Opoint Consulting, we manage nearly every step of the international
        recruitment process — so employment agencies can stay focused on their
        operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        From identifying suitable candidates to preparing them for the job and
        guiding them through legal and visa-related procedures, we provide a
        complete and structured support system. Every candidate we present is
        carefully pre-screened and fully informed about job duties, living
        conditions, and legal requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only responsibility of the employer is to apply for the work permit
        and prepare the necessary documents. From that point on, we take care of
        the rest — including explaining the employment contract, assisting with
        document preparation, and ensuring the process runs according to
        official rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also require our candidates to speak at least one international
        language — such as English or Russian — to support smooth workplace
        communication from day one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our procedures are fully aligned with legal and embassy requirements.
        However, we do not represent or influence any embassy — our role is to
        ensure that all documentation is complete, accurate, and compliant.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Foreign Workers</h2>
      <p>
        Many employment agencies in the EU face increasing difficulty finding
        reliable, long-term workers — especially for physically demanding or
        high-turnover roles. At the same time, skilled and motivated individuals
        from countries like Azerbaijan are actively seeking legal employment
        abroad for better pay and professional stability.
      </p>
      <p>
        These candidates are often more committed, disciplined, and eager to
        perform. When properly informed and legally supported, they arrive with
        a clear focus: work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opoint Consulting ensures that every foreign worker is: carefully
        selected based on employer needs, fully informed about job duties,
        housing, and legal terms, and supported with document preparation and
        visa-related guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
        We operate in full accordance with international employment laws and the
        official requirements set by embassies for visa and work permit
        processing. While we have no affiliation with any embassy or government
        institution, our role is to ensure that all documentation is complete,
        accurate, and compliant — giving both the worker and the employer the
        best possible chance of a smooth, legal recruitment outcome.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="expect">
      <h2>What We Expect</h2>
      <p>
        At Opoint Consulting, we believe that effective cooperation is built on
        mutual professionalism, transparency, and respect for legal standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before entering into cooperation, we kindly ask each employment agency
        to: be officially registered and licensed, follow local labor laws and
        legal recruitment procedures, and submit all required candidate
        documentation on time and with accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, a modest and refundable deposit may be requested from the
        candidate to cover verified preparation expenses. However, we strongly
        discourage excessive charges or profit-driven practices related to
        documentation — we only support fair and transparent handling of costs.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also expect agencies to provide: safe and clean accommodation, clear
        job descriptions with employment terms, basic logistical support (such
        as transport if needed), and a respectful working environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        We value open communication and flexibility. When agencies and
        candidates are both supported properly, the outcome is always more
        successful — for everyone.
      </p>

        and you.
